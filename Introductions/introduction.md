# Introduction

## What is Open Source?

Open Source refers to software whose source code is freely available for anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute. Unlike proprietary software, open source promotes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development. Some popular examples of open source software include **Linux**, **Python**, **Mozilla Firefox**, and **WordPress**.

## Why is Open Source Important?

1. **Collaboration & Learning**: Developers worldwide can contribute to projects, learn new skills, and share knowledge.  
2. **Transparency & Security**: Open access to the code ensures that anyone can inspect it, identify bugs, and improve security.  
3. **Innovation & Flexibility**: Open source encourages experimentation and rapid innovation, allowing developers to adapt software to their needs.  
4. **Cost-effective**: Open source software is free to use, which reduces costs for individuals, startups, and organizations.  
5. **Community-driven Support**: Active communities provide guidance, updates, and improvements, making the software more reliable.  
6. **Empowers Everyone**: Open source enables participation from anyone, regardless of location or background, fostering diversity and inclusion.
